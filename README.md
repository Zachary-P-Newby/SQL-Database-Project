# Overview

Zach's digital cookbook is a database containing various receipies found online and stored in here for easy access. You can browse through the database, search by an attribute such as a specific ingredient ingredient, and access the cooking directions to either display to the screen or print out.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of how created the Relational Database.}

Users will use a GUI to search for a recipie by name or filter them based on attributes,
and the program will access the the database and return results based on user's input.

# Relational Database

The Cookbook database consists of a single table called 'recipes', with coulumns for the author, name, source, total time, ingredients, directions, and nutrition facts of the recipe. There is also a searchIngredients coulum that lists the ingredients in a string that is optimized for searching by ingredient. There also coulumns for whether or not the recipe is vegan or contains certain ingredients like fish, eggs, or meat. These coulumns allow the user to catagorize the recipes by class, and filter based in ingridents.
